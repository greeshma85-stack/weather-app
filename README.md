#  Weather Application

A frontend web application that provides real-time weather information for any city.  
This project demonstrates API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and dynamic UI updates.

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – For structuring the application  
- **CSS3** – For styling and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript** – For application logic and API handling  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – For fetching real-time weather data

##  Features

- Search weather by city name  
- Displays temperature, weather condition, and humidity    
- Real-time data fetched from API  
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## The Process

1. Designed the application layout using HTML  
2. Styled the UI with CSS for clarity and responsiveness  
3. Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data   
5. Dynamically updated the UI based on API response  
6. Handled basic error cases like invalid city names

##  How This Project Can Be Improved

- Add location-based weather using Geolocation API  
- Show multi-day weather forecasts  
- Add temperature unit toggle (°C / °F)  
- Implement dark mode  
- Convert the project into a React-based application
